Prediction of the next Nankai megathrust earthquake

Nankai megathrust earthquakes are great megathrust earthquakes that occur along the Nankai megathrust, located in southwestern Honshu, Japan. The system comprises five interacting regions.

In this project, we try to predict the probability distribution of the next event.
